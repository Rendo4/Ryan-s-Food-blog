This potato salad is from downtown corvallis food truck Memphis BBQ! Clearly a winner from this presentation right? Theres a lot of texture,smells and taste going on here. Let's talk about ingridents first. 
## Ingridents
* Potatos _(of course)_
* Mayonaise
* White Vinegar
* Celery
* Eggs 
* Green onions
* Yellow Mustard
* Salt
The quality of the ingridents matters! The food truck gets golden Yukon potatos and fresh celery, with free range chicken eggs! **That's what i'm talking about!**
